# Genetic Algorithm (basic)
Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that draws analogy from gene evolution. It is a method of soft computing to reach to an aproximate optimal solution. 

## Motivation
A near optimal solution can be reached using the algorithm with a lot less computation relative to an algorithm implementing hard computing (gives exact solution).

## Code style
Python is used to implement the algorithm. Only two libraries, namely, math and random are used.

## Parameters
Changing these parameters alters the accuracy and speed of the algorithm:
(1) Precision level: epsi, (2) String/Chromosome length: l, (3) Mutation probability: pm, (4) Number of iterations: iteration, (5) Maximum and minimum values assigned to the variables: x1_max, x2_max, x1_min, x2_min, (6) Pool size: pool_size (input)
