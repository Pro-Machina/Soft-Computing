# Particle Swarm Optimisation
Particle swarm optimisation is a method that replicates swarm behaviour to find the optimum required solution. The position of each swarm particle is updated besed on the personal best and global best solutions found so far.

## Code style
Python is used to implement the algorithm. Only two libraries, namely, numpy and random are used.

## Parameters
Changing these parameters alters the accuracy and speed of the algorithm: (1) Inertia weight: w, (2)  Acceleration coefficient: c1 and c2, (3) Number of swarm particles: n, (4) Number of iterations: w
