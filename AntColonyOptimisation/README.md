# Ant Colony Optimisation
Ant colony optimisation is an evolutionary algorithm that draws it's analogy from the behaviour of ants and how they could reach to their food using the shortest path possible

## Code style
The code has been written in python with the use of two libraries, namely, numpy and random

## Parameters
Changing the parameters would effect the accuracy and computation time of the algorithm, these parameters are:
(1) Initial pheromone value: tau, (2) Number of ants: ants, (3) Evaporation coefficient: rho, (4) alpha and beta vales, (5) Pheromone count for each new trail: q, (6) Distance to cost conversion factor: k

## Traveling Salesman Problem
The algorithm solves a TSP problem which states that: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city? (Source: Wikipedia)
